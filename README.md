# Something-To-Make-Simile-
Waking up in your own skin 
Is better than anything
Grateful to be alive!!!***
Waiting on good fun actions to
Lead into Hide and Go seek**
^Seek and ye shall find^
^knock and the door will be open^
Just another day hope to 
See some fun turn "mourning into dancing". 
And see sorrow turn to Joy..
